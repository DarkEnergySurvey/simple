there is a significant speed in IO when calling fits.read() with the argument columns=['x,', 'y,', ...]

this should be implemented when reading the file, and should consider generating a list of these columns based off of the config vars,

i.e. in python, define
>>> COLS=[basis_1, basis_2, mag_1, mag_2, etc...]
>>> fits.read(infile, columns=COLS)

basis_1
basis_2
mag_1
mag_dered_1
mag_2
mag_dered_2

will need to find a clever way to handle the filtering...
